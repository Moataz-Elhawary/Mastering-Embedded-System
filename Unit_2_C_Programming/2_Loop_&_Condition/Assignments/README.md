Write C Program to Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd .    
The program idea : ↴                                     
Numbers perfectly divisible by 2 are known even numbers and numbers which are not divisible by 2 are 
called odd numbers. This program takes an integer from user and checks whether that number is even 
or odd and displays the result.

Output 1 ▶                                              
Enter an integer you want to check : 25  ➙ 25 is odd.                                              
Output 2 ▶                                         
Enter an integer you want to check : 12  ➙ 12 is even.

Write C Program to Check Vowel or Consonant .            
Alphabets a, e, i, o and u are known as vowels and all alphabets except these characters are known as 
consonants. This program asks user to enter a character and checks whether that character is vowel or 
not.

Output 1 ▶                                              
Enter an alphabet : i  ➙  i is a vowel.                                              
Output 2 ▶                                    
Enter an alphabet : G  ➙  G is a consonant.

Write C Program to Find the Largest Number Among Three Numbers .                    
In this program user is asked to enter three numbers and this program will find the largest number 
among three num
bers entered by user. This program can be solved in more than one way.

Output ▶                                                   
Enter three numbers : ( 12.2 , 13.452 , 10.193 )  ➙  Largest number = 13.45
