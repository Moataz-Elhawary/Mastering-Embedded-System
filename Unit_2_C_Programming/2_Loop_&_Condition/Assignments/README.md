The program idea : ↴                                     
Numbers perfectly divisible by 2 are known even numbers and numbers which are not divisible by 2 are 
called odd numbers. This program takes an integer from user and checks whether that number is even 
or odd and displays the result.

Output 1 ▶                                              
Enter an integer you want to check : 25  ➙ 25 is odd.                                              
Output 2 ▶                                         
Enter an integer you want to check : 12  ➙ 12 is even.
