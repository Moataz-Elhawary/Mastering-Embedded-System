The program idea : ↴                                     
This program asks user to enter a string and a character and this program checks how many times that character is repeated in the string entered by user. 

Output  ▶                                              
Enter a string : This website is awesome.                                            
Enter a character to find frequency : e                                                                                      
Frequency of e = 4                                 

Ⅱ [EX_2 : Write C Program to Find the Length of a String.](https://github.com/Moataz-Elhawary/Mastering-Embedded-System/blob/master/Unit_2_C_Programming/3_Araay_&_String/String/Assignments/EX_2.c)

The program idea : ↴                                           
You can use standard library function strlen() to find the length of a string but, this program computes the length of a string manually without using strlen() funtion. 

Output  ▶                                                       
Enter a string : Programiz                                                                                  
Length of string : 9                                                           

Ⅲ [EX_3 : Write C Program to Reverse String Without Using Library Function.](https://github.com/Moataz-Elhawary/Mastering-Embedded-System/blob/master/Unit_2_C_Programming/3_Araay_&_String/String/Assignments/EX_3.c)

The program idea : ↴                                        
You can only use library function strlen(),To find the length of the string

Output ▶                                                                            
Enter the string  : Pritesh                                                       
Reverse string is : hsetirp
