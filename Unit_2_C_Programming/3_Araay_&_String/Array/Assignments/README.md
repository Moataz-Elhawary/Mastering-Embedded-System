The program idea : ↴                                              
This program takes n number of element from user (where, n is specified by user), stores data in an array and calculates the average of those numbers.

Ⅲ [EX_3 : Write C Program to Find Transpose of a Matrix.](https://github.com/Moataz-Elhawary/Mastering-Embedded-System/blob/master/Unit_2_C_Programming/3_Araay_&_String/Array/Assignments/EX_3.c)
--                    
The program idea : ↴                                        
This program asks user to enter a matrix (size of matrix is specified by user) and this program finds the transpose of that matrix and displays it.
